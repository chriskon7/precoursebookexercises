# This is a website I found with a list of Ruby API's

I had a little trouble with this exercise because I do not know a lot about online API's 
so I hope I answered this correctly

I like a lot of these API's, I like how you can add them to your project.  There are different e-commerce API's that 
you could add to your site to allow consumers to purchase your product by using PayPal.  I think that's really neat!

There are also different social networking API's that can be added to help make your own social networking section on your site
